## 1. Agent
Agent = LLM + Observation + Thinking + Action + Memory
- **LLM**: Processes information, makes decisions, and executes actions
- **Observation**: Perception of the environment. An agent can receive messages from other intelligent entities in the environment.
- **Thinking**: Analyzes the results of observations and memory content, considers what action to take next. This decision-making ability is provided by the LLM.
- **Action**: The result of observation and thinking, determining what specific tasks to carry out. This is similar to tools in LangChain.
- **Memory**: Stores past experiences.

Difference Between Agent and Chain
- **Similarities**:
  - Both complete a series of tasks step by step to ultimately achieve complex goals.
  
- **Differences**:
  - **Chain**: A predefined sequence of tasks, i.e., static (what should be done in each step is determined in advance).
  - **Agent**: The tasks in each step are not predefined and can vary depending on the user's questions or scenarios (dynamic).

An autonomous agent only needs to be told the requirements, and does not need guidance on what to do first or next. It can autonomously propose a plan, execute it, and complete the task.

This is one of the most influential works in this field, providing an effective foundation for future multi-agent collaboration.

There are many potential application scenarios to explore in the realm of generative multi-agents.

### 6.1. Design of Each Agent's Properties

- Basic Information
- Past Experiences
- Interests and Hobbies

### 6.2. Memory Design

- **Recency** (Time proximity):
  - The closer an event is to the present, the more weight it carries.
  
- **Importance**:
  - Some events are more important than others, e.g., "Waking up" < "Promotion".
  
- **Relevance** 
  - Cosine Similarity


score = Recency x $\alpha_1$ + Importance x $\alpha_2$ + Relevance x $\alpha_3$

Reflection Extraction: Summarizing the Memory Stream
- Scheduled Task: Summarize periodically after a certain time.

### 6.3. Planning: Generating a Daily Plan for Each Agent
- Daily routine
- Add unique schedules based on the characteristics of the agent

### 6.4. React: Interaction Between Agents
- Whether interaction occurs
- Whether the original plan needs to be changed
