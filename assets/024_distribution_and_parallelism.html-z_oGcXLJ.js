Batch Size (bs)</h4><p>Affects both model convergence and throughput</p><p>A small batch size can be useful early in training to quickly move along the training landscape reaching an optimal learning point. However, further along the model training, small batch sizes will keep gradients noisy and the model may not be able to converge to the most optimal final performances. At the other extreme, a large batch size while giving very accurate gradient estimations will tend to make less use of each training token rendering convergence slower and potentially wasting compute.</p><p>Batch size also affects the time it takes to train on a given text dataset: a small batch size will require more optimizer steps to train on the same amount of samples. Optimizer steps are costly (in compute time) and the total time to train will thus increase compared to using a larger batch size. This being said, note that the batch size can often be adjusted quite largely around the optimal batch size without major impact to the performance of the model, i.e. the sensitivity of final model performances to the exact batch size value is usually rather low around the optimal batch size.</p><p>Batch size extension links:</p><ul><li>OpenAI Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06162</li><li>MiniMax-01 Paper: https://filecdn.minimax.chat/_Arxiv_MiniMax_01_Report.pdf</li></ul><h4 id="_3-2-2-batch-size-tokens-bst" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-2-batch-size-tokens-bst" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.2.2.

FP16 and BF16 Training</h3><p>Simply switching all tensors and operations to float16 format usually doesn&#39;t work, often resulting in divergent loss values. However, the initial mixed precision training paper proposed three techniques to maintain the performance of float32 training:</p><ul><li>FP32 Copy of Weights: <ul><li>Using float16 weights can encounter two issues. During training, some weights may become very small and be rounded to 0. Even if the weights themselves are not close to 0, the magnitude difference may cause weights to underflow in addition operations if the update amount is very small. Once weights become 0, they will remain 0 in subsequent training because no gradient signal is passed.</li></ul></li><li>Loss Scaling: <ul><li>Gradients face similar issues because they are often much smaller than 1 and prone to underflow. A simple but effective strategy is to scale (amplify) the loss before backpropagation and then reverse scale (reduce) the gradients after backpropagation. This ensures no underflow occurs during backpropagation, and the scaling operation doesn&#39;t affect training because we reverse scale before further processing gradients (e.g., clipping) and optimization steps.</li></ul></li><li>Accumulation: <ul><li>Performing certain arithmetic operations (e.g., averaging or summing) in 16-bit precision may also encounter underflow or overflow issues. The solution is to use float32 precision to accumulate intermediate results during operations and only convert the result back to 16-bit precision at the end.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The core goal of these three techniques is to leverage the computational acceleration brought by low precision while ensuring training stability by introducing high precision (e.g., float32) operations to avoid numerical instability issues (e.g., gradient or weight underflow). Through these techniques, we can benefit from faster low precision arithmetic operations while maintaining training stability, resulting in higher throughput.</p><h3 id="_5-5-fp8-training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-fp8-training" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.5.
